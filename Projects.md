## Personal Game Engine Framework Projects

### Engine5
Engine5 is my fifth game engine project.
It is a project to develop 3D games and is the result of refactoring from previous engine3 and engine4.

The areas developed so far include 3D rigid-body physics, basic 3D rendering, loading some essential resource files, data-driven game data management, and so on.

### Fatti-Engine
Fatti-Engine is my second game engine project.
It is a project to develop 2D games and is also a game engine that improves the shortcomings that I felt while developing Shepherd Boy.
 
Based on the Fatti-Engine, I tried three game jams and it was a very interesting experience. "The Moon" is a game made of Fatti-Engine during the game jam in the fall of 2016. 

Fatti-Engine supported with 2D rigid-body physics, 2D rendering, in-game editor, data-driven development application, etc.

## Team Projects

### The Moon
The Moon is a game made of 24-hour game jam in the fall of 2016. The game was developed as a Fatti-Engine, and it was a game jam that was first time to use in-house game engine. At that time, I went through some bugs and crashes, which I had never seen in the usual unit tests.

Especially at this time, resource loading and unloading was carried out with the game level switched state. However, the game design of further inquiries required the background sound to be connected at the end of the level, which required temporary modification of the resource unloading mechanism of the game engine.

### Shepherd Boy

### Abort! Space Exodus
