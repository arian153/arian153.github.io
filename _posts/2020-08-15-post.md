## Summary
The Moon is a game made of 24-hour game jam in the fall of 2016. The game was developed as a Fatti-Engine, and it was a game jam that was first time to use in-house game engine. At that time, I went through some bugs and crashes, which I had never seen in the usual unit tests.

Especially at this time, resource loading and unloading was carried out with the game level switched state. However, the game design of further inquiries required the background sound to be connected at the end of the level, which required temporary modification of the resource unloading mechanism of the game engine.
