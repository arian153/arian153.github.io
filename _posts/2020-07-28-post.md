# Engine5
![alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/engine-5th/e5-1.png "Engine 5th")

## Summary
Engine5 is my fifth game engine project.
It is a project to develop 3D games and is the result of refactoring from previous engine3 and engine4.
The areas developed so far include 3D rigid-body physics, basic 3D rendering, loading some essential resource files, data-driven game data management, and so on.

## API, Frameworks
* Win32
* DirectX 11
* Direct2D
* DirectWrite
