## Summary
Junior Student Project
Team Size: 15
Roles: Gameplay, AI, UI, Producer
UE4 | Blueprints

Project Neon was the first Blueprint project I experienced. I'm not a founding member of this one year term game project, but from the second semester, I've become a team and developed it.
The most important thing I learned in this project is that communication with other professions such as designers and team members is always very important.
