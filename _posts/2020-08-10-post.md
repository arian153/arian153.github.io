## Summary

Student Game Jam Project
Team Size: 3
Roles: Core Engine Programmer, Physics Programmer, Graphics Programmer
C++ | OpenGL

Fatti-Engine is my second game engine project.
It is a project to develop 2D games and is also a game engine that improves the shortcomings that I felt while developing Shepherd Boy.
 
Based on the Fatti-Engine, I tried three game jams and it was a very interesting experience. "The Moon" is a game made of Fatti-Engine during the game jam in the fall of 2016. 

Fatti-Engine supported with 2D rigid-body physics, 2D rendering, in-game editor, data-driven development application, etc.
