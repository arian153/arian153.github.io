My name is Jangseok Han (한장석). 
Usually I go by Eric Han.
I am a student at DigiPen Institute of Technology. 
Precisely my major is a “BS in CS in RTIS”. 
The RTIS is a computer science major which is focusing on the Real-Time Interactive Simulation.

I like game development, and I like to learn game programming skills.
In addition, I am interested in technical aspects such as physics simulation, graphics renderer, etc.
